About
=====

Bare essentials for building abstract syntax trees (AST) and Python `lex`-`yacc` ([PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply)) parsers. The package includes:

- two classes for tree nodes: `Terminal`, `Operator`
- a `Lexer` and `Parser` class, and a helper function to erase and rewrite the table files.

The examples under `examples/` demonstrate how to use these classes to create a richer AST, a parser, and different backends that use the same parser.

These classes provide the boilerplate for parsing with PLY, and are based on code that was developed in [`tulip`](https://github.com/tulip-control/tulip-control) and [`promela`](https://github.com/johnyf/promela).
