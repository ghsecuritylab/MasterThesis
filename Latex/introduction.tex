Internet of Things (IoT) 



is known as the concept of connecting everyday physical devices to the Internet. It is natural to assume that the popularity and development within this field will increase in the following years. This means that more and more things will be able to communicate over the Internet. In the process of developing IoT, an important part is to build reliable and scalable networks, and understanding where data should be processed concerning power consumptions and costs of transfering data in different parts of the network.
