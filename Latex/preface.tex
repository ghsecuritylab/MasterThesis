This thesis was issued by the Department of Telematics (ITEM) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) the spring of 2016 as a Master Thesis in Telematics. 
The responsible professor has been Frank Alexander Kraemer, ITEM, who has given
helpful advices on how to build up and write such a large project, as
well as answering questions and giving support the whole period. David Palma has been the supervisor, giving impressively close monitoring of the project to fill in ideas, thoughts and good advices to help me finish the thesis. I would like to thank both these ITEM representatives for the work they have put down to make this project as good as possible. 

Secondly I would like to thank fellow students for the many discussions, good advices and other more social activities the last five years. I would like to point out the guys at A-179 for their support, Jon Anders for helping me with code specific problems during the programming period, and Anders for the many hours we spent together setting up central parts of the network described in this thesis. Special thanks to you!

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my family for their support both during the period of this thesis, but also during my entire period as a student. Special thanks to my father, Svenn Arne, for helping me review the thesis and to get a discussion point with someone without a technical background.
