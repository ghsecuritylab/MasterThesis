Understanding Data Analyzis in an End-to-End IoT Network

This is my Master Thesis in Communication Technology with specialization within Networks, Services and Applications from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. 

The thesis will describe how to build a full End-to-End IoT network to gather data from sensors using technologies as 6LoWPAN and Bluetooth Low Energy as well as physical sensors from Adafruit, the nRF52 from Nordic Semiconductor and the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3.
